## CENTIS
### Human-Centered Immersive Systems

Welcome!

The research group CENTIS (Human-Centered Immersive Systems) is part of the [Forschungs- und Weiterbildungszentrum Kultur und Informatik](https://fki.htw-berlin.de/) (FKI) at [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/). 
The research focuses on the requirements and needs of users and the development of innovative 3D technologies. Virtual-, Augmented-, Mixed- and Extended-Reality (VR, AR, MR, XR) as well as Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) are used.

[Our team](https://fki.htw-berlin.de/centis/team/) is responsible for the technical concepts, developments and scientific methods in various projects. 
The focus of the work and scientific investigations is on the support of creative processes such as immersive sketching and modeling as well as cross-device content creation, the possibilities for participation in immersive environments, 
human-centered 3D object manipulations, health-enhancing immersive solutions as well as the integration of immersive media concepts into applied research areas.
